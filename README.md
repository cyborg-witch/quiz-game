Quiz game

I build this application as part of my learning of React course(by Scrimba).

Quiz build with HTML, CSS, JavaScript.

How it works

Quiz has general geographic questions from open database and any question with answers, any answer you press on is saved as your answer.
When you answered all questions of the quiz and press "Check answers", you get a score and all incorrect answers displayed with red background and correct answers are with green backround. You can play over and over again by clicking "play again" button.
If you got all the answers right confetti is popping in the end.
